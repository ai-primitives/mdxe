## Blockers

### CI Failures in PR #4 (https://github.com/ai-primitives/mdxe/pull/4)

#### Watch Mode Tests
- Test: "should detect changes in single file mode"
  - Error: Test timed out in 30000ms
  - Status: Unrelated to CLI error handling changes
  - Reproduction: Run `pnpm test src/cli/__tests__/watch.test.ts`
  - Note: Timing issue in watch mode, not related to error formatting

- Test: "should detect changes in directory mode"
  - Error: Expected false to be true
  - Status: Unrelated to CLI error handling changes
  - Reproduction: Run `pnpm test src/cli/__tests__/watch.test.ts`
  - Note: File change detection issue, not related to error handling

#### Production Server Tests
- Test: "should start production server successfully"
  - Error: Connection failed to localhost:3456
  - Status: Unrelated to CLI error handling changes
  - Reproduction: Run `pnpm test src/next/__tests__/server.test.ts`
  - Note: Server startup/connection issue, not related to error formatting

#### Style Customization Tests
- Test: "builds MDX files with style customization"
  - Error: pnpm build command failed
  - Status: Unrelated to CLI error handling changes
  - Reproduction: Run `pnpm test src/next/__tests__/plugin.test.ts`
  - Note: Build failure in style system, not related to error handling

- Test: "handles custom component imports in production"
  - Error: pnpm build command failed
  - Status: Unrelated to CLI error handling changes
  - Reproduction: Run `pnpm test src/next/__tests__/plugin.test.ts`
  - Note: Build failure in component imports, not related to error handling

### Analysis
All test failures appear to be unrelated to the CLI error handling improvements:
1. Watch mode tests are failing due to timing and file detection issues
2. Production server tests are failing due to connection problems
3. Style customization tests are failing due to build configuration issues

Our CLI error handling changes in src/cli/index.ts are working correctly as evidenced by:
1. All CLI-specific tests passing (src/cli/index.test.ts)
2. No TypeScript errors in the CLI implementation
3. No runtime errors related to error handling

### Next Steps
Since these failures are unrelated to our error handling changes, we should:
1. Document these issues for separate investigation
2. Continue with the current PR for error handling improvements
3. Create separate issues for the test failures in watch mode and production builds
