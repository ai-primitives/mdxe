# Using Components in MDX

This example shows how to use custom components in MDX files.

## Local Components

Using a locally imported button:

<Button>Click Me!</Button>

## Exported Components

The `components` export makes components available globally:

```jsx
export const components = {
  Button
}
```

Now other MDX files can use these components without importing.
